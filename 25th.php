            Quick recap
          </h2>
          <p class="h3">
            Exactly three years ago, I started the tradition of writing a TwitLonger for my birthday. Mainly for reflection and to share my thoughts during this rollercoaster of a day. It started with my <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sq1qnn">22nd birthday post</a> and I skipped the 23rd for some reason (I honestly don't remember) and then on my <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sqv05b">24th birthday post</a> I shared my thoughts from Kenting's gorgeous national Forest in Taiwan right next to the area’s beautiful Beach. Surreal, I know!

            The Big 25 and the Biggest dream achieved!
          </h2>
          <p class="h3" >
            A quarter of a century, that realization on its own feels both intimidating and exciting! But guess what? I AM A FIRST-CLASS GRADUATE! Four years ago, in 2016, when I was in the planning stage of my Bachelor’s journey, I told myself “Don’t even think about First-class!” while digging up information about how schools categorize their graduates. I wasn’t being pessimistic or anything I was being realistic; I graduated high school in 2012 from a public school in Saudi Arabia that used Arabic as the main medium of teaching and now after I forgot everything, I am going to one of the best private Computer Science universities in Malaysia! Today, I can proudly say that not only I got an unprecedented A+ grade in my Final Year Project but also the biggest, unattainable, and unrealistic dream was ACHIEVED!! I cannot describe how that puts a smile on my face every time I think about it.

            I got my own Website now!
          </h2>
          <p class="h3" >
            To honour the fact that I am now a Software Engineer, I thought to myself “what is the best way to showcase this new skill with my birthday post?” A website! Traditionally, a website is perfect for a fresh graduate to share their portfolio rather than simply not having one and relying on sharing stuff manually. Granted this version of the website is a very early static version but baby steps! I will eventually develop demos for my work and at least a comment section for my blog! Slowly but surely, baby steps into giant strides, right? Developing and Maintaining this website is definitely a new strategic goal that will surely pay off in the near future.

            Staying in Malaysia? Future career?
          </h2>
          <p class="h3" >
            I cannot count how many people asked me this question. What now? Are you staying in Malaysia? What about your family and friends? I always have one very simple answer. I don’t know because while I would love to work near my family and friends, professionally, it might not be the best decision. Definitely though, the next biggest decision of my life is upon me and its frightening to be quite honest. The current mood feels a lot like four years ago when I was planning the next chapter of my life. I’m open to opportunities virtually anywhere in the planet though, I would never limit myself. May the collectively best opportunity wins!

            2019 Smash?
          </h2>
          <p class="h3" >
            After the unforgettable <a href="https://twitter.com/moom1/status/1142827205560434689">project Tea</a> and my awesome visit to the Taiwanese community, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainJacksan/status/1203626727236222976">I won a monthly tournament VS. the Japanese Melee legend Captain Jack</a> then followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/MyOffstage/status/1211893485898362886">winning Comic fiesta 2019 in Kuala Lumpur</a> it was a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBbn5MFC3gc&feature=youtu.be">set</a> with a crazy stage filled by live audience. My team’s <a href="https://twitter.com/cocodrilosgg/status/1209822147725742080">Arabic announcement</a> followed the win very shortly. Of course there should have been more stuff after comic fiesta but (Obligatory Covid19 stay safe mention) hahaha.

           Future of smash?
          </h2>
          <p class="h3" >
            Smash is a part of my soul. It’s my passion. It is going to stay forever as a part of my life. The end.

           Final words
          </h2>
          <p class="h3" >
            To everyone who had faith in me from my family and friends, thank you so much I can never pay you back or properly express my gratitude. There is an uncountable number of moments that would have been disastrous if you were not there. I will always love you.
